This is an assignment for the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. The directions were to make multiple summary tables using different filters to determine the average and total prices of those who decided to purchase additional items in this free-to-play video game, and also the average and total prices of the items that were purchased.

Below I will write a few of the observations I made from the dataframes that I created from the data.

One of the major obersvations that stood out right away were the amount of males who purchased items compared to females and non-disclosed genders. However, males typically spent less on the items in the same comparison. Another trend of the data had to do with the age groups that made purchases and that about 76.73% of total purchases came from users aged between 15 and 29. This is obviously the already assumed demographic when dealing with video games, but I am just confirming that with what the data points out. It came to my attention after looking through the data that the age ranges could potentially be skewed if parents were making purchases for their younger kids, depending on how the data was obtained. Regarding items purchased, there were only two items that were purchased more than 10 times. This could help the gaming company trying to improve their sales by designing more popular items based on those two items and determining why they were the most popular.
